# Here's a sample rexe script that I've been using in my development of rexe. It:
#
# 1) pipes the help output of rexe into another call to rexe, which
# 2) removes the first and last blank lines for easier pasting into the source code, and
# 3) pastes the result back into the clipboard for easy insertion into the editor.

rexe -h | rexe -mb -op 'self.split("\n")[1..-1]' | pbcopy
